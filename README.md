# npm scripts

A very small repository to automate monitoring, with the help of npm scripts, node-sass and nodemon.  
I wanted to do this without a task runner like **Gulp**, and, if possible, put these npm scripts in a dedicated folder.  
This is something I wanted to do for a long time and after reading this [article](https://medium.com/@brianhan/watch-compile-your-sass-with-npm-9ba2b878415b), I wrote this repo.
